Dice potatoes, cover with water and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium and simmer 5-8 minutes until fork-tender.
Drain, return to stock pot. Drizzle with vinegar and toss to coat, then cool to touch (20-30 minutes).

_Dressing_: While potatoes cool, whisk together mayo, celery salt, mustard, and relish.

Dice the eggs, celery, and onion. Add to cooled potatoes, fold in dressing, and toss gently to combine.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill at 1-2 hours before serving.

Leftovers keep refrigerated up to 3 days.

> Optionally, add basically anything. Bacon, shredded cheese, chives, dill, parsley, corn, carrots, cucumber, bell peppers, green onions...
