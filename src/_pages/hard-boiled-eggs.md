**For slightly jammy yolks, and easy peeling**:

Bring 3 litres of water (very large pot) to a boil.

Lower eggs into boiling water, boil 30 seconds, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 11 minutes.

Drain, place in ice water 15 minutes.

**For chalky yolks, less fussy**:

Place eggs into cold water, sufficient to cover plus one inch.

Bring to a boil, then turn off heat and let sit on warm burner covered for 13 minutes.

Drain, place in ice water 15 minutes.
