"Bastion City" style, via Roberta and Dave.

#### Crust

1. Place a bowl over a pan of boiling water.
2. Melt butter, stir in sugar.
3. Add all other ingredients (cocoa through nuts) and stir until thickened.
4. Press into a 9x13" pan, chill 15 minutes.

#### Cream Filling

Beat butter, custard, milk, and sugar together, spread over base and chill.

#### Chocolate Icing

Melt chocolate and shortening in microwave or double boiler. Spread over custard.

### Prep

Chill slightly, until chocolate icing is no longer "wet-looking", then slice. If chocolate gets too cold, it cracks when sliced.

Refrigerate or freeze.
