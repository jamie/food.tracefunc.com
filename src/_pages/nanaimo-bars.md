#### Crust

Place a bowl over a pot of boiling water. Melt butter, stir in sugar.

Add remaining ingredients, stir until thickened.

Press into a 9x13" pan, chill 15 minutes.

#### Cream Filling

Beat ingredients together, spread over base and chill.

#### Chocolate Icing

Melt chocolate and shortening in microwave or double boiler. Spread over custard.

### Prep

Chill slightly, until chocolate icing is no longer "wet-looking", then slice. If chocolate gets too cold, it cracks when sliced.

Refrigerate or freeze.
